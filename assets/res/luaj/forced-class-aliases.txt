# Some classes have the same name and can not be aliased automatically (see scripts/.definitions/class-aliases.lua and scripts/.definitions/global-c.lua)
# This file tells Lua def generator which class to use if there's a class name conflict
# Classes listed here will be aliased by their simple name and will appear in the global C table
# Also these aliases are not likely to be changed in the future, so they are safer to use than the automatically generated ones
