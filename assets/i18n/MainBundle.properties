hint_msg_1=<@buff-health-bar-icon-freezing>[#4DD0E1]Freeze[] debuff is less effective against <@buff-health-bar-icon-burn>[#FFB74D]ignited[] enemies
hint_msg_2=[@icon_tag_basic_tower]Basic tower[] has the best coin-to-damage ratio at the start of a game but it is also the weakest tower in a long run
hint_msg_3=In Developer mode, do not type into the <@icon-terminal>console and do not install scripts that you are not sure about - this may lead to loss of progress or harm your device
hint_msg_4=<@tower-sniper>[#81C784]Sniper[] deals massive damage to single targets, but aims slower if the target is in a crowd
hint_msg_5=The effectiveness of multiple <@tower-sniper>[#81C784]Snipers[] drops if they aim at the same enemy - when the target is killed, all snipers will have to aim at a new enemy
hint_msg_6=<@tower-cannon>[#E57373]Cannon[] has a Shrapnel ability, which adds shards to the explosions, allowing you to reach more distant enemies. The shards also deal full damage to <@enemy-type-light>[#4DD0E1]Light[] enemies that are immune to <@icon-explosion-range>explosions.
hint_msg_7=<@icon-explosion-range>Explosions deal the most damage at their epicenter, and each enemy hit by the explosion partially covers other enemies behind them from the explosion
hint_msg_8=<@tower-freezing>[#4FC3F7]Freezing tower[] increases the duration of the <@buff-health-bar-icon-poison>[#AED581]poison[] and the length of the <@icon-lightning-bolt>chain lightning for all enemies in its range
hint_msg_9=<@tower-freezing>[#4FC3F7]Freezing tower[] slows down enemies gradually, enemies affected by several of these towers slow down faster
hint_msg_10=<@tower-freezing>[#4FC3F7]Freezing towers[] gain experience for <@buff-health-bar-icon-freezing>[#4FC3F7]slowing down[] enemies. Enemies that are already slowed down will not give experience to the next tower if they don't unfreeze at least a little first
hint_msg_11=<@tower-venom>[#AED581]Venom tower[] prioritizes targets that haven't already been <@buff-health-bar-icon-poison>[#AED581]poisoned[] by it
hint_msg_12=The effects of multiple <@buff-health-bar-icon-poison>[#AED581]poison debuffs[] stack, but each next effect deals 25% less damage (effects are applied in order from strongest to weakest)
hint_msg_13=<@enemy-type-fast>[#FFF176]Fast enemies[] lose 5% speed per <@buff-health-bar-icon-poison>[#AED581]poison debuff[] and can be slowed down by 75% max
hint_msg_14=<@tower-venom>[#AED581]Venom tower[] projectiles deal full damage on impact and then deal <@buff-health-bar-icon-poison>[#AED581]poison[] damage over time
hint_msg_15=<@tower-splash>[#FF8A65]Splash tower[] has an ability that gives bonus damage to slow enemies - this can be useful in combination with <@tower-freezing>[#4FC3F7]Freezing tower[]
hint_msg_16=<@tower-freezing>[#4FC3F7]Freezing tower[] has a very useful side effect - slowed down enemies gather in a denser crowd, which is easier to kill with AOE damage
hint_msg_17=<@tower-blast>[#90A4AE]Blast tower[] can knock enemies back towards portals, effectively containing them and gathering them into a tighter crowd
hint_msg_18=<@tower-blast>[#90A4AE]Blast tower[] deals <@icon-explosion-range>explosive damage - the closer enemies are to the tower, the more damage they take
hint_msg_19=Different towers are differently effective against different enemies. You can view the effectiveness of the tower in the build menu or in the tower menu when the GUI scale is set to < 90%
hint_msg_20=<@tower-multishot>[#FFF176]Multishot tower[] can deal a lot of damage to a group of enemies if placed at the right angle to the road
hint_msg_21=<@tower-multishot>[#FFF176]Multishot tower[] is especially effective against <@enemy-type-fast>[#FFF176]fast[] enemies and can attack airborne enemies
hint_msg_22=<@tower-minigun>[#CE93D8]Minigun[] is the fastest firing tower, but it takes time for it to pick up speed. When the tower is not attacking, it loses speed
hint_msg_23=<@tower-minigun>[#CE93D8]Minigun[] is especially effective against single strong enemies, and it can also set enemies on fire at full attack speed
hint_msg_24=<@tower-air>[#4DD0E1]Anti-air tower[] is the most effective defense against air enemies. It can set enemies on fire, dealing a damage equal to a percentage of their maximum health per second
hint_msg_25=<@tower-air>[#4DD0E1]Anti-air towers[] have an ability to explode downed enemies. During the explosion, nearby ground enemies take massive damage
hint_msg_26=<@tower-tesla>[#7986CB]Tesla's[] chain lightning always travels to the nearest enemy in a range of 1.5 tiles
hint_msg_27=<@tower-tesla>[#7986CB]Tesla's[] lightning damage is reduced for each enemy it hits. The percentage of damage is listed as the corresponding stat in the tower's menu
hint_msg_28=<@tower-tesla>[#7986CB]Tesla[] has an ability with which it can release lightning balls if there are no enemies near the tower. Lightning balls move towards a random portal and deal massive damage to the first enemies they encounter
hint_msg_29=<@tower-missile>[#F06292]Missile tower[] is able to reach enemies at any distance thanks to its Long Range Missile (LRM) system, which works if there are no enemies in the range of the tower
hint_msg_30=<@tower-missile>[#F06292]Missile tower[] projectiles will seek out a new enemy if the current target has already been destroyed
hint_msg_31=<@tower-missile>[#F06292]Missile tower[] can deal a lot of damage to enemies at full health thanks to its Special ability
hint_msg_32=<@tower-flamethrower>[#FFD54F]Flamethrower[] is especially effective against large clusters of enemies that are difficult to destroy one by one
hint_msg_33=<@tower-flamethrower>[#FFD54F]Flamethrower[] can set enemies on fire, but this makes the <@buff-health-bar-icon-freezing>[#4FC3F7]freezing[] debuff weaker. "Cold fire" ability will instead slow down enemies without penalties for the <@buff-health-bar-icon-freezing>[#4FC3F7]freezing[] debuff, but enemies will no longer receive damage over time
hint_msg_34=High frequency ability of a <@tower-laser>[#4FC3F7]Laser[] makes its beam pierce through enemies and ignite them
hint_msg_35=<@tower-laser>[#4FC3F7]Laser[] can't turn while firing, so it's better to choose a place where the enemies can't quickly get out of its line of fire. Large batteries ability allows <@tower-laser>[#4FC3F7]Laser[] to rotate
hint_msg_36=On maps with multiple <@tile-icon-portal>[#BA68C8]Portals[], the number of enemies in each wave does not increase. Enemies are evenly distributed between <@tile-icon-portal>[#BA68C8]Portals[]
hint_msg_37=Enemies go through turns at different speeds, depending on which side of the road they are closer to. Roads with several consecutive turns in the same direction allow you to disperse a crowd of enemies
hint_msg_38=You can turn off visual effects in settings or pause menu to improve performance and save power
hint_msg_39=<@icon-miner-top>Miners are the most efficient at extracting resources of their color. More advanced <@icon-miner-top>miners can mine more types of resources, but they will do it much slower
hint_msg_40=When selling a <@icon-miner-top>miner, the resources mined by it will not be lost
hint_msg_41=<@tile-icon-source>[#5C6BC0]Source tiles[] on custom maps have a limited amount of resources. When all resources are mined, <@icon-miner-top>miners will continue to work as usual, but you will not get more resources at the end of the game
hint_msg_42=When selling a tower, all the experience accumulated by it is lost
hint_msg_43=[#DCE775]<@icon-modifier-balance-research>Balance modifier[] allows towers to share their experience and level up faster. Towers with the maximum XP level will give all extra experience to other towers with a lower XP level
hint_msg_44=[#64B5F6]<@icon-modifier-search-research>Search modifier[] allows nearby towers to constantly search for new targets according to their aiming mode, even if the current target is still within range
hint_msg_45=[#F06292]<@icon-modifier-power-research>Power modifier[] gives a huge bonus to the stats of the neighboring towers, but constantly takes away their experience. The modifier will give a bonus even if neighboring towers cannot give experience
hint_msg_46=<@icon-modifier>Modifiers will not take away experience from the tower if it will reduce its XP level
hint_msg_47=[#E57373]<@icon-modifier-damage-research>Damage[] and [#FFB74D]<@icon-modifier-attack-speed-research>Attack speed[] modifiers negatively affect adjacent towers if placed in corners
hint_msg_48=Do not forget to use [#4DB6AC]<@icon-modifier-mining-speed-research>Mining speed modifier[] if you are going to farm some resources

lvlsub_4_1_020_levels_become=Levels are becoming more entangled and enemies more sophisticated.
lvlsub_4_1_030_this_is_all=This is all because we have been working with real data for a long time - real data that I need to get access to lower levels of the mainframe.

lvlsub_4_1_050_you_went_too_far=You went too far to stop, like me, so we do it - I open new opportunities for you, and you deal with the data.

lvlsub_4_8_020_it_is_like_stakey=It is a bit like Stakey - the chain of enemies is dragging behind the main module, but this time it's a bit more complicated.
lvlsub_4_8_030_head_is_completely=The head is completely invulnerable to all damage while any part of the body remains. Therefore, you must first break all the parts of the body, and then deal with the head.
lvlsub_4_8_040_all_parts_of_body=All parts of the body are resistant to bullets and explosions when health drops to 66%. When health drops to 33%, the resistances reverse and the parts are vulnerable to explosions and bullets.

lvlsub_5_1_040_rockets_will_look=Rockets will look for a new target if the current one has already been destroyed - not a single rocket will be wasted.
lvlsub_5_1_050_there_are_also_disadvantages=There are also disadvantages - the turret has a minimum attack radius and the rate of projectile rotation is limited.
lvlsub_5_4_010_i_decided_that=I decided that there was not much fire and developed a new tower for you. Meet the Flamethrower.
lvlsub_5_4_020_a_flamethrower_can=A Flamethrower can cause continuous damage to a group of enemies of any density and set them on fire for a few more seconds. An indispensable weapon against a crowd of small enemies.
lvlsub_5_4_030_but_remember=But remember - Freezing tower will freeze ignited enemies 3x slower and 33% less effective. However, this can be fixed with the Cold Fire skill.

lvlsub_5_8_040_but_our_goal=But our goal is the Metaphor, the last boss. And I have no information about it. Sorry, I cannot offer any advice.
lvlsub_5_8_050_broot_will_appear=Broot will appear in a few waves!

lvlsub_5_8_096_well_quess_who_coming=Well, guess who's coming in next 5 waves, and looks like Ensor made him a Trojan horse - as soon as you kill it, enemies will become able to walk on Platforms!
lvlsub_5_8_097_but_we_have_something=But we have something against this - put some towers on empty platforms to make it harder for them to pass.
lvlsub_5_8_100_good_job_now_starts=Good job, now the most interesting part begins - the Metaphor.
lvlsub_5_8_110_just_a_few_waves=Just a few waves, and we'll meet with him. Get ready!
lvlsub_5_8_120_uses_small_enemies=Apparently, he uses small enemies to distract attention from himself. They behave very strangely - these, for example, have a huge amount of health, but they also take much higher damage.
lvlsub_5_8_130_seems_that_he_has=It seems that he has a force field that turns off the towers nearby...
lvlsub_5_8_140_he_turned_off=He turned off our strongest tower! This happened when health fell to 75%.
